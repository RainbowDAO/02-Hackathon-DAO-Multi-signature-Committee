## Short pitch



  - Solution: 



Our system is mainly the voting election and fund proposal application system of the multi-signature committee organized by DAO. It also mainly contains two parts:



1. The voting function of the DAO multi-signature committee is different from our DAO multi-signature wallet system. Its multi-signature administrator is not designated, but is elected by voting. It has a complete process of candidate registration, voting, publicity of voting results, and committee impeachment. Publicly elect members of the multi-signature management committee through a series of strict standard procedures;

   

2. When the multi-signature management committee is successfully elected, they are responsible for the fund approval function of the multi-signature vault. Any eligible holder of governance tokens can initiate a proposal to the multi-signature vault and apply for community governance funds. There is also a complete funding proposal approval process.





  - Pain: 



This system also solves two pain points:

1. The voting management function of the multi-signature management committee is to elect the corresponding multi-signature members through the voting of governance token holders, and can impeach and supervise the multi-signature management members, so that the entire committee is more fair and clean;

   

2. Solve the funding proposal approval process, so that any eligible holders of governance tokens can apply for funding in the form of proposals from the multi-signature vault. The entire project is transparent and accepts the supervision of the entire community.



  - Target audience: 

The target audience of our product is mainly various DAO organizations of various types. Meet their needs for financial management. Realize decentralized management of fund approval and fund appreciation through multi-signature wallets.

This product is suitable for all types of DAO organizations, whether it is a large DAO organization or a small DAO organization. Everyone can apply it to actual fund management. Its function is very practical for DAO organization.
